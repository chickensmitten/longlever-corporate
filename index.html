        David is created from the inspirational story or David and Goliath. Whereas Goliath was well equipped with armor, shield and sword; David only has some smooth pebbles rock and a leather sling. That still didnâ€™t stop David from defeating Goliath.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this is the story we are trying to live by. We imagine a tool maker, calling for David, giving him the simple tools he needed to defeat Goliath.
      </p>
      <p>
        HeyDavid is created to remind us that even with simple but sufficiently effective tools, we can overcome adversity.
